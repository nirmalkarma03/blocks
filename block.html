		<blockquote>
	Pratap Singh I, popularly known as Maharana Pratap , was a Hindu Rajput king of Mewar from the Sisodia dynasty. He fought several major battles against Akbar including the Battle of Haldighati in 1576 to resist the expansionist policy of the Mughal empire. Pratap became a folk hero for his military resistance through guerrilla warfare which proved inspirational for later rebels against Mughals including Malik Ambar and Shivaji.
